# Virgo

Are you a Virgo, or do you have a special Virgo in your life? As earth signs, Virgos are known to be practical and deeply rooted in their ways. Understanding Virgo personality traits is essential to creating the best life for yourself or the Virgos around you. Read on for key Virgo personality traits, a guide to understanding Virgos in relationships, and general advice for Virgos.

## What Is a Virgo?

A Virgo is a person born between August 23rd and September 22nd. Virgos are known for being practical, sensible, and loyal. They make excellent friends and partners.

Virgos are known for being perfectionists, and can be meticulous and single-minded in their pursuit of improvement. However, this also makes them extremely dedicated to the people in their lives, and helps them find success professionally.

## Virgo Personality Traits

While everyone is different, there are some key traits you should be aware of when it comes to Virgos. Knowing these Virgo characteristics will help you navigate the world if you are a Virgo, or relate to the Virgos in your life.

### Positive Virgo Traits

Virgo is an earth-sign, which is demonstrated in their practical and logical tendencies. Some of their best qualities are because they're such thoughtful, well-grounded people.

#### Hard-Working

Virgos know that hard work pays off. They aren't afraid to throw themselves into a project, no matter what it takes, and may even go some sleepless nights.

#### Creative

Virgos throw themselves into their creativity as much as their other passions. Their creativity is always flowing and they use mediums like art, dance, and writing as an outlet.

#### Reliable

You'll be hard-pressed to find someone more responsible and reliable than a Virgo. When left in charge, Virgos are sure to take their responsibilities seriously, and they'll always show up when you need them to.

#### Patient

While no one is infinitely patient, Virgos are more patient than others. They're always willing to see the best in people, and are willing to give people time when they need it to shape up their act.

#### Kind

Virgos are also humble and affectionate. Along with their desire to see the best in people, they are unfailingly kind and are always willing to help others.

### Negative Virgo Traits

Of course, Virgos aren't all perfect, and like most signs, some of their biggest strength can also be points of weakness.

#### Critical

Virgos are hard workers and great at what they do, but these high standards can also make them overly judgmental and critical towards others.

#### Stubborn

Virgos can be especially set in their ways. Since they're so dedicated, they often think that they know best, and are reluctant to change their minds or change their ways.

#### Overthinking

As critical thinkers, Virgos can also be chronic over-thinkers. Their minds are so busy all the time, constantly thinking about things they need to do or how they can get ahead on their next project. This means they also overthink emotions and relationships.

#### Picky

Again, Virgos are pretty set in their ways and are not easily convinced to try something new. They also run the risk of being critical about others' choices when they're not the Virgo's first choice.

#### Uptight

Overthinking and worrying are classic Virgo traits. They are bothered by lots of little things, and are often told by friends that they need to chill or relax. Lots of Virgos are what we'd think of as type A personalities.

### Virgo Traits in Relationships

In all aspects of life, knowing the traits of your star sign can help with your relationships. Part of the Virgo personality is their intensity, so if you're a Virgo, knowing how to relate to people is essential to forging long lasting and fulfilling relationships.

#### Romantic

Virgos thrive on deep and intellectual connections. They are supportive and loyal romantic partners, and take a deep interest in their loved one's interests and life. A Virgo will genuinely make an effort to get to know their partner's interests and their mind, and is subtle in expressing their feelings and showing their affections.

Virgo characteristics are romantically compatible with Taurus, Scorpio, Cancer and Capricorn traits.

#### Platonic

As a naturally shy and reserved sign, Virgos have a hard time opening up and making new friends. However, once they do they're amazing friends who should always be the first call for anyone in need, or just if you need a good talk about life. Virgos love connecting with others, and this applies in their friendships and with family members, too.

Virgos would do best with a Scorpio bestie who understand their quiet intensity and can bring out their emotional side.

#### Professional

Unsurprisingly, Virgos make great employees! Their critical thinking and analysis skills mean that they are always looking for the next big thing and how to improve on their work.

Virgos have to beware of their critical tendencies at work, and make sure they have their filters on so that they don't say things they can't take back and jeopardize opportunities.

## Advice for a Virgo

1: One of the most important things for a Virgo to remember is to relax. Take a step back from work and remember to enjoy the little things. Try to schedule time for breaks well in advance, and stick to it.

2: Surround yourself with people who can help you access your emotions, but understand your intellectualism. It's best to have friends who are different from one another, so that you can feel balanced and respected.

3: Try to remember that not everyone takes criticism well, and that you're not always right. What works for you may not work for someone else. Practice taking a beat and thinking before you speak to ensure you don't hurt feelings by accident.

4: Channel that famous work ethic into projects that bring you happiness. You'll work hard at everything you do, but you don't have to always grind away at work. You can help friends and family, volunteer, and work on your art.

5: Use that natural creativity (one of the most common Virgo traits!) to tap into your emotions. Practicality can come across as cold, so practice connecting with your emotional side with the added benefit of working on the things you care about. Bonus points if you do these activities with friends or a romantic interest.

## Tips for Relating to a Virgo

1: Remember that Virgos are not naturally open emotionally, but this doesn't mean they don't have feelings. Virgos need plenty of space, but also need to be convinced that they are loved and cared about.

2: Respect that Virgos are over-thinkers, and will sometimes create their own anxious feelings. This can sometimes translate to insecurities over their relationships. Be patient and let them work through the feelings.

3: Virgos love hard work and throwing themselves into projects and new things. Encourage the Virgo's interests, and remember that their single-minded dedication to whatever is going on in their life is natural for them.

4: Don't take advantage of the Virgo's generosity or patience. Virgos will always be there for you, and are extremely dependable in any situation. However, their tendency to give people a second chance and give them the benefit of the doubt can leave Virgos feeling put upon, and feeling like a relationship is one-sided.

5: If a Virgo appears sharp-tongued or critical, it's probably not personal. They're perfectionists, and just want everything done according to their own standards. Try to talk to them to get a sense of their vision, and help them find more friendly ways to express this vision.
