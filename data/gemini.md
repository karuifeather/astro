# Gemini

Gemini traits are more varied than those of other astrological signs. While most signs have one very prominent trait (for example, Capricorns are notoriously ambitious), Geminis, those born between May 21 and June 21, can be social, talkative, and whimsical, but they can also be indecisive or nosy. Some Geminis love to be the center of attention; others love to gossip. They're typically passionate yet easy-going beings who are always down for an adventure or intellectual conversation.

If you hang out with a Gemini, only one thing's certain: you'll never be bored.

## Gemini Personality: 7 Key Gemini Traits

The Gemini personality is very fun, but, like every sign, Geminis have weaknesses. Their strengths are that they're adaptable, outgoing, and intelligent—there's never a dull moment with a Gemini. However, their weaknesses are that they're indecisive, impulsive, unreliable, and nosy—be careful telling a Gemini your deepest darkest secrets.

### Gemini Strengths

#### #1: Adaptable

Geminis are easy-going and adjustable. They're willing to try anything at least once, so do not play truth or dare with them, you're going to lose. They'll be happy to go along with any plan and will likely plan some fun adventures. Your craziest stories will involve your Gemini friends.

They're also very flexible and able to change on a dime. Spoiled plans won't ruin their day; they'll just think of something better to do. Make sure to enlist your Gemini friend's help planning parties since they'll often come up with the best ideas.

#### #2: Outgoing

Geminis are typically enthusiastic, social beings. They're the life of the party—talkative, but not annoyingly chatty. They always have something interesting to say. They're never just having a boring conversation about the weather; they're usually partaking in deep conversations about life. Geminis make great wingmen, wingwomen, or wingpeople because they easily strike up conversations with strangers. Be careful, though, they might outshine you!

#### #3: Intelligent

The reason Geminis always have interesting things to say is that they're highly intelligent. They're inquisitive, so they love to learn. You'll often find Geminis with a book in their hands. (Definitely ask your Gemini friends for book recommendations.)

They're also clever and love to partake in witty banter. So think carefully before trying to debate a Gemini; you'll probably lose.

### Gemini Weaknesses

#### #4: Indecisive

Due to their intelligence, Geminis can be overly analytical which can lead to indecisiveness. Don't ask your Gemini friends to pick a dinner spot or Netflix movie; they'll agonize for hours over what to choose. They can also be anxious or nervous about making decisions, especially big decisions like moving or changing careers. Dating Geminis can be difficult because they struggle with commitment. I'll explain this more in the Gemini in love section below.

#### #5: Impulsive

The flipside of the adaptability of Geminis is that they can be a little impulsive. Because they're so flexible, they can change their minds in a heartbeat. This trait can lead them to make reckless decisions and can cause them to do superficial things. Geminis can be tempted to buy an expensive leather jacket for fun when they're struggling to pay their rent. If you're a Gemini, be careful when wielding a credit card!

Their impulsiveness can also make it hard for them to accomplish their goals. Geminis can lose focus or interest in their tasks and move on to something else.

#### #6: Unreliable

Due to their impulsiveness and inability to commit, Geminis can be flighty. If you make plans with a Gemini, beware; they might cancel on you at the last second. They aren't mean-spirited; they're just a little irresponsible. Geminis try to avoid responsibility and boring activities at all cost. Don't count on them to help you pack or help you move, but count them in for a fun night out.

#### #7: Nosy

The flipside of Geminis' intelligence and curiosity is that they can be nosy. They want to know everything about everyone. It can be exciting when they encourage you to share your deepest secrets or when they're giving you the lowdown on everyone else, but be careful before telling your dirty little secrets to a Gemini—you never know who they might tell them to.

## Gemini Man Vs. Gemini Woman Personality

Gemini men and women share the Gemini traits above but exhibit them in different ways.

Gemini men tend to be very outgoing, almost to a fault. They're very enthusiastic, which makes them fun to be around, but they also want to be the center of attention, so hanging out with them at parties can get old. If you really want to get to know them, you should spend time with them one on one. Gemini men are also huge flirts, so if you're dating a Gemini man, maybe don't introduce him to your hot friends.

Gemini women are very passionate about life but are very hesitant when it comes to love. Due to their intelligence and indecisiveness, Gemini women agonize about the important decisions in their life. If you're dating a Gemini woman, be patient with her; it may take her longer to commit to a serious relationship. However, Gemini women are very witty and outgoing; you'll always have fun spending time with a Gemini woman.

## Gemini in Love

As I said, Geminis are always down to try anything once, which makes them very adventurous lovers. If you're looking for the perfect fling, pick a Gemini. They're extremely passionate and fun, which makes them exciting mates. They'll plan romantic getaways and take you on adventures. However, due to their indecisiveness, they can be scared or wary of commitment. If you're dating a Gemini, be careful; you might get your heart broken.

The best thing you can do to keep a Gemini is to communicate. Geminis want honest and open communication in relationships. Don't try to keep any secrets from a Gemini. Geminis typically have a number of different partners before finding the right one to settle down with. Geminis need someone who is a match for their intellect and who is willing to have fun. When Geminis find the right partner, they're extremely faithful.

## Gemini With Friends and Family

As very social beings, Geminis tend to spend a lot of time with their friends and family.

In their friendships, Geminis are looking for good communication. Geminis tend to lose touch with long distance friends if there is a lack of communication. Geminis want to have deep conversations but also want to gossip with their friends.

Geminis also want to have fun with their friends. Geminis can be flaky, especially if the planned activity is boring, so don't count on them to help you study or do your taxes. They may not be the most reliable friends. However, you're always going to have a good time when you hang out—Geminis plan the most fun activities. The best nights of your life will be spent with your Gemini friends.

Family means a lot to Geminis, but it can sometimes be a burden to them. Family responsibility can get in the way of their desire to be spontaneous. Geminis would much rather go out with their friends than babysit their cousin. Nonethless, Geminis want loyalty and good communication in their relationships with family. They tend to be best friends with their siblings because loyalty and understanding are pre-built into the sibling dynamic.

## Gemini in Business

Geminis tend to make good artists, writers, and journalists due to their inquisitive nature, adaptability, and outspokenness. Geminis always bring innovative thinking and passion to their work. Geminis love to uncover interesting stories and tell interesting stories. Some famous Gemini artists include Kanye West and Morgan Freeman.

All of the above Gemini traits also make them great salespeople. Geminis have great communication and are great at witty banter which makes it easy for them to win people over. This also makes Geminis great managers. Their enthusiasm inspires their subordinates, and their intelligence gains the respect of other employees.

Due to their impulsiveness, Geminis are not great at working on long-term projects because they eventually lose interest. Geminis are not very good accountants or bankers. Geminis work best when they're able to jump from project to project, so they don't lose interest.

## Gemini Compatibility: Best Romantic Matches

The three best matches for the Gemini characteristics are Libra, Aries, and Aquarius.

Libra and Gemini are a perfect match. They're equals in terms of intelligence and outgoingness, and they share a common interest in art and culture. Both love to have a good time. They're both adventurous in bed, so the connection will always sizzle. They both have strong communication, so it'll be a strong relationship.

Aries and Gemini make for a match full of excitement since both signs are very outgoing and enthusiastic. An Aries will love a Gemini's zest for life. They're bound to have lots of adventures together. An Aries is a natural born leader, which is nicely complemented by a Gemini's intelligence. They'll love to learn together.

An Aquarius and a Gemini will have fun being spontaneous together—they both love surprises. Aquarius and Gemini are both very independent, so they may want time apart from one another. However, both thrive on strong communications which will ensure a good foundation for the relationship. They'll be friends as well as lovers.

## Worst Matches for Gemini Romantic Compatibility

The three worst Gemini compatibility matches are Pisces, Virgo, and Scorpio.

A Pisces is typically very sensitive, so they do not pair well with the unreliability of a Gemini. A Pisces will be hurt when plans get canceled because the adventure-seeking Gemini made better ones. This relationship will be full of deep rooted resentment and has little chance of harmony. A Pisces is simply too emotional for a Gemini.

While both Virgos and Geminis are extremely intelligent, they'll get on each other's nerves. Virgos are meticulous in their study, which will bore a Gemini. Virgos, who love precision, will hate the flexibility and unreliability of a Gemini. They'll likely drive the Gemini away by over criticizing them.

Scorpios as introverts clash with outgoing Geminis. Scorpios, who tend to be intense and serious, will find Geminis to be superficial. The two are essentially opposites, and while opposites can occasionally attract, it's unlikely for this duo.

### Advice for Gemini

If you're a Gemini, what should you do with all of this information? Well, you should start by thinking about which Gemini traits apply to you specifically; not all of the above Gemini traits will apply to every Gemini. Figure out your specific strengths and weaknesses.

If you're adaptable, use that strength to your advantage. Explore unknown territory in your life trusting that you'll be able to figure out what to do. Fight for a promotion or change career paths: you're flexible and intelligent, so you'll succeed.

Are you outgoing? If so, go out with your friends, and meet new people. You never know what good might come from striking up a conversation with a stranger: you could meet the love of your life or get yourself a job.

Are you always told how clever you are? If yes, then embrace it: dive into reading more or try to learn a new skill. Make yourself indispensable at work; figure out what needs to be done and how to do it, and then do it. You're smart enough to do anything.

Think you might be indecisive? Try to work on your decision-making skills. If you're struggling to make a decision, consider making a quick list of the pros and cons. If the pros outweigh the cons, then do it! If the cons outweigh the pros, you might want to consider another option.

Are you a bit impulsive? Find yourself spending too much money? Try to create a spending budget for yourself. Tabulate your total necessary monthly expenses: food, rent, gas, etc. Then, figure out how much beyond that you feel comfortable allocating for fun money (i.e. shopping, going out to eat, etc.). Force yourself to stick to that budget!

Do your friends sometimes call you unreliable? Do you cancel plans often or show up late all the time? You tend to be unreliable because you want to find something better to do. Rather than thinking about the reasons a task or activity is boring, try to find the excitement in everything. If you focus on the positives, you'll be more likely to stay focused and interested.

Think you might be nosy? Find yourself stalking people on Facebook all day long? Love gossiping about other people? While you may want to know your friend's secrets, she won't trust you unless you're willing to tell her your own. Be conscious about what questions you ask. Ask yourself would I be comfortable answering this question? If the answer is no, don't ask it!

### Advice for Relating to a Gemini

If you're having trouble connecting to a Gemini (whether in a relationship or at work), you should try to make things more fun or interesting. For example, if you're dating a Gemini, make dates "surprises." Don't tell your partner what you're doing or where you're going. It doesn't cost you anything but will make the date more exciting for your Gemini lover. If you're trying to connect to a Gemini at work, try to bond with one over a drink after work. They're more likely to open up in a fun, social environment than in the sterile office breakroom.

Still having trouble connecting to a Gemini? If making things more fun didn't work, try connecting on an intellectual level. Strike up a conversation about a book, article, or movie you liked; Geminis love to have deep discussions.

Don't take it personally when a Gemini bails on plans. Remember the Gemini traits: Geminis can be flaky and unreliable. They're not trying to hurt your feelings. If you're dating a Gemini, be extra patient with them when it comes to commitment. Geminis struggle to commit due to their flakiness, but Geminis are extremely loyal when they find the right partner. Remember to always communicate honestly with a Gemini; they're more likely to stick around if you tell them how you're feeling.
