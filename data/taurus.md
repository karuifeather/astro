# What Is a Taurus?

A Taurus is anyone with a birthday between April 20 and May 20. Taurus is the second of the 12 astrological signs and is represented by the bull constellation. Of the four zodiac elements (air, earth, fire, and water), Taurus is an earth sign.

Taureans, like the bull that represents them, are known to be intelligent, dependable, hardworking, dedicated, and stubborn. But there's more to the Bull than meets the eye. Let's dive in and learn all about the Taurus personality, from its good side to its bad side.

## Key Taurus Characteristics

In astrology, each zodiac sign is represented by one of three modalities: cardinal, fixed, or mutable. A sign's modality is just another way of saying, "This is how this sign expresses itself." The Taurus modality is fixed, meaning people born under this sign tend to be reliable, persistent, and stable.

But there are many other fascinating Taurus characteristics besides just having a grounded nature. Here are some of the most important Taurus traits to know.

### Positive Taurus Traits

Taureans are considered to be the anchor of the zodiac. Their fixed modality means that Bulls love their stability and find comfort in consistency. Anything or anyone that endangers that or their sense of security could find themselves facing a very angry tour de force!

People born under the Taurus sign also value honesty above all else, so don't try to pull a fast one on them—they'll never forgive you if they find out you've deceived them.

Like their celestial animal representative, Taureans don't shy away from hard work and aren't afraid to do what it takes to get the job done. In other words, if there's a Taurus in your group for a class project, you're in great hands! Coupled with their hardworking nature is a level of ambition and mental tenacity that makes Taureans a true force to be reckoned with.

But it's not all work for these Bulls. As an earth sign that's also ruled by Venus, Taureans love pleasure and enjoy all things luxurious and cozy. "Work hard, play hard" is a motto that can definitely be applied to this sign. With a taste for the finer things in life, the Taurus sign knows how to relax and have a good time.

### Negative Taurus Traits

Just as bulls are known for their incredible stubbornness, people born under the Taurus sign are often viewed as being very set in their ways. If you ask them about it, they'll just tell you it's their dedicated nature and not them trying to be difficult. This quality makes them super resistant to change.

Additionally, Taureans aren't fond of authority and might challenge a teacher or professor who they believe is wrong about something or just wasting their time. So you know that one student in class who's always talking back to the professor? Probably a Taurus.

If they're not careful, Taureans can take their pleasure-seeking ways too far. Such hedonistic tendencies can lead to outright laziness and procrastination, which never looks good on anyone!

On the other end of the spectrum, Bulls can be huge perfectionists. If something or someone isn't absolutely perfect, Taureans are known to turn up their noses and walk away.

### Taurus Traits in Relationships

Flaws and all, a relationship with a Taurus is almost always a good thing. Here's what to expect from a Taurus personality in romantic, platonic, and professional relationships.

#### Romantic

You can bet that a zodiac sign with Venus (the goddess of love) as its dominant planet won't shy away from romance. Because of Taureans' love of perfection, need for stability, and resistance to change, they won't rush into a relationship with just anyone. No, their partners have to be something spectacular.

If you're dating a Taurus, be advised that it might take time for them to make you the Mary Jane Watson to their Peter Parker (or vice versa). Once a Taurus has chosen you, though, their loyal, genuine nature means they're in it for the long haul.

If you're the Taurus in the relationship, try not to fall into the trap of looking for perfection and be sure to enjoy your paramour exactly as they are in the present moment.

#### Platonic

Taureans are the Hufflepuffs of the zodiac. As friends, they're trustworthy and dependable. Unlike those sneaky Slytherins, the Hufflepuffs would never cheat in a Quidditch match or lie to you about that sweater you think looks cute but actually makes you look like a soggy marshmallow.

Bottom line: get yourself a Taurus friend, stat.

#### Professional

In their professional lives, Taureans are patient, reliable, and very thorough. When given a specific task, they'll address it with laser-sharp focus until it's complete. If you've got a Taurus employee or coworker, this is the person you want working on major projects that need a meticulous hand.

That said, this intense concentration can make it difficult for the Taurus sign to focus on more than one task at a time, so it's usually best if they can work through a project in its entirety before starting on another.

Generally speaking, Bulls enjoy making money (it's what allows them to live in luxury, after all!) and will therefore work diligently to maintain a sense of stability. You can always count on a Taurus to be a faithful employee, coworker, or boss!

## Advice for Taurus

It's great being honest, but as a Taurus, you want to take care not to come across rude or hurtful. This isn't to say you should lie—telling the truth is in your nature, so there's no point in trying to fight it!—just that you should practice gathering your thoughts so you can produce a more thoughtful and sensitive response.

When it comes to school and jobs, Taurus characteristics can go one of two ways: way too invested or way too lazy. If you're more of the former, embrace your ability to focus and get tasks done, but make sure to take breaks, ask for help if needed, and avoid sacrificing all your comfort.

If you tend to be on the lazier side (it's OK—we all have our flaws!), work on getting yourself out of those cycles of procrastination by making a schedule and holding yourself to it.

Lastly, don't be afraid to stick to your guns whenever you're faced with a hard decision or an opinion you don't agree with. Your stubbornness is there for a reason: it prevents you from being easily persuaded (and possibly deceived) by others. When in doubt, simply ask for evidence; you can always change your mind if you truly want to. Just don't do it because someone tells you to!

## How to Relate to the Taurus in Your Life

If you have a Taurus in your life (or are crushing on one!) but aren't sure how to connect with them, don't worry—we've got you covered.

The first thing to remember is that Taureans love to work hard and love to unwind just as hard. So if you can, bond with a Taurus over a shared work ethic and a love of chillaxing (Netflix, anyone?).

Second, be prepared to answer some tough questions. If a Taurus is considering letting you into their world, they're going to vet you by grilling you. Remember that not just anyone gets past these Bulls! If you can hold your own, chances are pretty good you just made a new (Taurean) friend.

Finally, expect some stubbornness. Taureans are not always going to be willing to change their ways or minds just because you're their friend, partner, boss, etc.

This applies to Taurean children as well, who might even go so far as to challenge your authority as a parent. If that's the case, it's a good idea to have a serious sit-down talk with them to explain your point of view and, in turn, listen to theirs.
